## 💡 **About**
This repository contains various C programs that I've developed as part of my coursework and personal study in my first year of college. The projects span a variety of topics, from basic syntax to more advanced algorithms. It's a reflection of my growth in programming, with each project serving as a stepping stone to more complex challenges ahead.

## 🔑 **Key Concepts**

Here's a breakdown of some core topics I covered in these projects:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding fundamental data structures.
- **Control Structures**: Mastering `if` statements, loops, and switches.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable and modular code.
- **Arrays and Strings**: Manipulating collections of data.
- **Pointers**: Diving deep into memory management and address manipulation.

  
Each project folder contains code that focuses on one or more of these concepts, building upon previous work to further enhance my skills.

Each folder includes:
- **Source code (.c)** files
- Sample input/output to understand how the program works
- Comments explaining key sections of the code

Feel free to explore, test, and even improve these projects!

## ⚙️ **How to Use**

If you want to run these programs on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/happyresh/c-practice.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired project folder**:  
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder-name>
   ```

3. **Compile the C program**:  
   Use the GCC compiler or any C compiler you prefer. For example:  
   ```bash
   gcc program.c -o program
   ```

4. **Run the compiled program**:  
   ```bash
   ./program
   ```

> 💡 *Note: You need to have GCC installed on your system to compile C programs. For Windows, you can use [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/), and for Mac/Linux, GCC usually comes pre-installed.*
