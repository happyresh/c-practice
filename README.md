# C Practice Repository 🖥️

Welcome to my C programming practice repository! This repository contains a collection of C language programs that I developed during my 1st year at **Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Manila**. The files here represent my journey and progress in understanding fundamental programming concepts in C. 🚀

## 🌟 About

This repository features various exercises and projects that cover core programming concepts such as arrays, loops, functions, and more. Each folder is categorized based on the topic or type of exercise to make it easier to navigate.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Here’s an overview of the folders and files included in this repository:

- **ARRAYS**: Programs and exercises focusing on arrays and their manipulation.
- **C FUNCTIONS**: Demonstrations of how functions work in C, including both user-defined and standard library functions.
- **LOOPS**: Contains examples of different types of loops, such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- **FINAL**: Final submissions or advanced exercises from my 1st year.
- **Personal Works**: My personal experiments and projects in C, exploring more advanced or custom topics.
- **School Works**: Academic exercises assigned during my coursework.

## 🔥 Highlights of My Work

### Arrays 🗂️
- **Title**: Array Manipulation Techniques
- **Objective**: Learn how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays in C.
- **Key Concepts**: Sorting algorithms, searching techniques, multi-dimensional arrays.

### Functions in C 🔧
- **Title**: Function Design and Modular Programming
- **Objective**: Understand the importance of reusability by creating modular, maintainable functions.
- **Key Concepts**: Recursion, pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference, function pointers.

### Looping Constructs 🔁
- **Title**: Loop Mastery
- **Objective**: Master the use of different looping structures.
- **Key Concepts**: Nested loops, infinite loops, and control statements.
